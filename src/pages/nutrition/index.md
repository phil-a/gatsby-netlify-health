# What is Holistic Nutrition?

As a Certified Nutritional Practitioner, a question I am often asked is "what is holistic nutrition?"

Holistic nutrition is an alternative health care that takes into consideration a person's physical health, emotional health, environmental health, and spiritual health. 

> Consciousness leads to thought, thought leads to emotion, emotion leads to physical manifestation.

Holistic nutrition encompasses the MIND, BODY, & SPIRIT when looking at an individual. Clients are viewed as a whole, meaning we look at the foods you eat, what you drink, your lifestyle habits, your sleep habits, your health history, your stress levels, your emotional health, your fitness regime, time for yourself, toxin exposure, etc.

## What Does a Holistic Nutritionist Do?

Holistic nutritionists design individualized protocols based on clients' biochemical individuality. We use clinical assessments called "symptomatology" to evaluate your body by the combination of symptoms it is producing.

Every person is unique, therefore, every client seen receives

an individualized protocol based on your symptoms. These

protocols are designed to address the root cause of your body's ailments using:

    - Food as medicine
    - Herbal medicine
    - Lifestyle changes
    - Professional-grade Supplements​​

All this is done to rebalance your body. We cannot and do not make diagnoses. We instead assess the health of your body and the contributing factors and support what needs to be supported.

My private practice is called "Desire Radiant Health" for many reasons. One of them is you must firstly **DESIRE** health before ATTAINING it. Therefore, you cannot heal without the desire to do so.
