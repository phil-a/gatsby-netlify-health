        Lay down, close your eyes, and allow me to safely balance your energy centres using pendulum dowsing. During energy healing, I truthfully believe I do nothing and your body is doing all the work. I'm simply a guide and asking your higher self what needs to be done at this time.

        During energy healing, many people feel so relaxed that they fall asleep. That's completely fine and only allows me to work further and deeper without your thoughts or worries inhibiting the process.

        Lay down and relax while we correct your vibration using tuning forks, crystal singing bowls, and Tibetan singing bowls.
        Any crystals/gems necessary may be placed around you for maximum energy healing. Pendulum dowsing will also be incorporated into the session to assess your chakras and see where you need more attention.

        You will feel beyond relaxed and renewed during this session. Enjoy the healing power of sound and correct your body's frequencies.
