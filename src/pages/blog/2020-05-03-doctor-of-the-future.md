## Prevention is the Key!

The majority of the clients that see me usually have their own "wake up call" to change their lifestyle and diet completely after a huge or drastic event happens to them. That's completely understandable and makes sense for us to not want to change until we have to or it's unavoidable because until that point, it appears that everything we're doing is okay.

[Body Whispers](https://www.amazon.ca/Body-Whispers-Unraveling-Emotional-Spiritual-ebook/dp/B00WEWD2P2) written by one of my teachers, Amira Ayad, PhD, is a book about listening to our body's whispers until they turn into a scream. That is a powerful statement and visualization to contemplate. We must collectively recognize what our body is trying to communicate through soft whispers, listen to those smaller warning signs (fatigue, headaches, subtle pain, indigestion, constipation) that many people are able to ignore and live with, until those whispers get louder and we can't ignore them anymore.

When I was 20 years old, on the hospital bed outside the surgery room to get heart surgery, in that moment I told myself I would never drink or do drugs again. I obviously had very good reason to and in my head it was my way of treating myself the best way I possibly could by not ever abusing her with substances. [Not that I was a big drinker nor smoked marijuana often before that, but it was very good motivation for me to not decide to do that again.] I never desire alcohol at all now. 

A lot of people wait for drastic experiences like heart surgery, or a diagnosis, or a health crisis to finally decide to change and take their health seriously. But if we all realized the power of prevention, that wouldn't have to be our reality.

Though I understand my clients, and I've been there myself, I want to give motivation for living a healthy lifestyle even if nothing is apparently 'wrong'. For example:

> Even if nothing's wrong, avoiding common allergies is always a great idea. 

> Even if nothing's wrong, avoiding refined processed food is always a good idea. 

> Even if nothing's wrong, avoiding alcohol or substances is always a good idea.

Your body is your temple. Nourish it the best way possible with the food and care it deserves. It will thank you.
