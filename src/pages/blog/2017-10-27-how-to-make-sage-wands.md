As you know, I'm a holistic nutritionist, but a large part of my practice is energy healing! If you're a previous client of mine, you know I dedicate 30 minutes at the end of your Initial Assessment to energy healing. In the video above, watch me make my very first sage wands/smudge sticks and learn from me [and from my mistakes] how to make your own! It's quite easy once you get the hang of it. 

Ingredients you will need: 
- Sage
- Lemonbalm (optional)

Tools you will need: 
- Garden Twine
- Thread
- Scissors
- Anything to hang the wrapped sage wands from and elastics to secure them

Let them dry for 2 weeks approximately, hanging upside down. The sage leaves should feel soft, dry, and crunchy.

Once they're done drying, burn them to clear negative energy. Enjoy the wonderful benefits of sage smudging!
