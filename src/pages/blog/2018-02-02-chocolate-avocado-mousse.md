Valentine's Day is in a couple days and I got just the recipe for you! 

 

Even if it's not Valentine's Day, I've literally made this for myself for breakfast. Anyone want to have dessert for breakfast? What if I told you it was possible and actually good for you! Especially your brain, your hormones, and your heart!

 

This is my second attempt at a chocolate avocado mousse, and not to brag, but it is pretty amazing! 

 

Being the holistic nutritionist I am, of course I had to add some superfoods to this concoction! Enjoy this recipe! And if you have a loved one you wish to share this with, they're one lucky partner of yours!
