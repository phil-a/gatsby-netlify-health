Watch my instructional video of how to make your own natural toothpaste! There are only 7 ingredients to make such a healthy alternative to store bought mainstream toothpaste. I recommend to avoid conventional toothpaste brands containing fluoride, sodium lauryl sulfate, triclosan, etc. There are natural toothpastes available in most health food stores, though I'm a DIY girl at heart. The joy of making it yourself is you get to control everything in it, the quality, the flavours, and it's very rewarding.
