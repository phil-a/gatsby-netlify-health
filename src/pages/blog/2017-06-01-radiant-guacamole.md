You've probably heard a lot about avocados lately (like the new adorable emoji), but these fruits (yes, they are fruits) are loaded with B vitamins! B vitamins are your anti-stress vitamins. Anti-stress vitamins are great for all of us in North America.

"How are B vitamins supposed to reduce my stress?" You ask?

Well, B vitamins are needed by your adrenal glands (and your thyroid gland!) Your adrenal glands are those adorable glands sitting on top of your kidneys, and they mediate your short-term and long-term stress responses! Your short term stress response consists of epinephrine and norepinephrine (commonly referred to as adrenaline and noradrenaline). Your long-term stress response consists of cortisol and aldosterone. These small but mighty glands can use all the help they can get from our diet and lifestyle!

Avocados are also high in healthy fats! They're especially high in monounsaturated fats. Do not fear, healthy fats are critical to your health! They also have three times the amount of potassium of a banana!
 

Recipe:

1 Avocado (ripe)

1 clove of Garlic (crushed)

1/4 cup Extra Virgin Olive Oil

Juice of 1 Lime [or 1/2 a lemon]

1/2 tsp. Himalayan salt

1 tsp. Red Chili Pepper Flakes

1/4 tsp. Turmeric Powder (optional)

1/4 tsp. Black Pepper

1-2 chopped Garlic Shoots [or 1 scallion]

I honestly mash this together with a fork! It's that easy. If you want it super-smooth, blend it in a food processor. Fork smashing = less dishes to wash though*. Plus I like chunkier guacamole.

Pictured here, I'm enjoying it with organic gluten-free Mary's Crackers and cucumber slices! I usually layer it: cracker, guacamole, and cucumber on top! 

Can you say yum?

Go make it!

This can easily be a meal or a snack on a busy day.

I'll share more recipes soon!
