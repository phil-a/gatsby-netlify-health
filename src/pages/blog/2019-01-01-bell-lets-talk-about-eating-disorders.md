description: People often forget that eating disorders are a severe mental illness. I want to add to the conversation and give room to those with ED's to share their experiences.

I recovered from two eating disorders myself. I feel so lucky that when I speak about it, it feels like I'm speaking about another person. It's so distant from my current reality that it doesn't even feel like I'm speaking about myself. That means I'm truly free.

 

If you suffer from eating disorders and you want to be free from them as well, contact me via my website. I'd be happy to help you on your journey to recovery.
