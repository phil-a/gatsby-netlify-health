The question we are all asked at all ages, ever changing with time and circumstances.

 

I'll start. Today I can say I am brave, determined, I love to laugh, dance, sing, practice yoga, learn, eat healthy, enjoy the outdoors, connect to spirituality, connect to nature and animals, etc.

 

Eight years ago, I would have answered with labels of my most recent diagnosis. 

 

 

My 17-year-old self wrote in my diary: 

 

"So as of today, I have...

- Supraventricular Tachycardia

- Binge-eating disorder

- Clinical depression

- Generalized anxiety disorder 

..."

 

 

Yes, that's how I identified myself. What have I learned since then? That's how most people identify! They don't identify with their personality and their interests, but instead with their illness(es). You are not a disease. You are a living, breathing, human being with an immaculate and original personality. Don't dull your presence by your illness. "Mind over matter" truly is the best motto. 

 

You feel better when you think highly of yourself and your value. Think about the frequencies of the words you are saying. Do they emit low frequencies or high frequencies that radiate throughout your body? These are important things to think about.

 
 

YOU are intelligent. 

YOU are motivated.

YOU want to improve your health.

YOU are determined.

 

You are free to identify however you want, but be mindful of your words as they do manifest.

 

Try this experiment: Wake up every morning and recite "I am healthy" or "I am radiant" and repeat these mantras on a daily basis. After a few weeks you may notice you love your mornings more and more and that your body really does listen to your words!

 

We are spiritual beings in a human existence. What we say and believe really does effect us and our entire being. It's not enough to just be mindful of your thoughts, but to really BELIEVE your thoughts.

 

Have a lovely and radiant day,
