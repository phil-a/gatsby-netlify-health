This is my intuitive Guided Sound Bath Journey & Meditation on the night of Ostara Spring Equinox. Using crystal singing bowls, a Tibetan singing bowl, chimes, rain sticks, and my voice. Recorded on March 19, 2020.

We are in a very interesting moment in time, I share my thoughts on that before the sound bath journey begins and why I've chosen to make this a very love based sound healing experience for you all at this time of isolation. 

If you'd like to skip my message, thoughts, and explanation of why I chose a love based sound journey, you can skip to 03:00 to start watching when the guided sound journey begins. 

PS. If you're interested in a personal sound healing experience, you may book an appointment here.

May all your wishes come true, creative endeavours blossom, and love grows.  

Radiant Love and Health to you all, 

Olivia
