Millet is an ancient seed that has been cultivated for over 10,000 years! Why isn't it more popular? It is a seed that is cooked like a grain but contains no wheat and is suitable for those sensitive or allergic to gluten.

If you have a pet bird, you may recognize millet as 'bird crack' as they are literally addicted to millet and will eat a whole cob of millet at a time if you let them. 

Compared to wheat, rice, and corn, millet is richer in protein and magnesium. It's also high in Vitamins B1, B2, B3, & B6, and fibre. Like most seeds and grains, I recommend soaking it in water first and rinsing it before cooking it. The other ingredients in this porridge are common favourites of mine: hemp hearts and chia seeds for fibre, calcium, iron, and omegas 3, 6, and 7. The wild blueberries and apples are packed with antioxidants.  

In the winter time, it's recommended to eat warmer foods, so I incorporate more steel cut oats or rolled oats in my breakfast to give me something warmer than smoothies and chia puddings... but I really crave change and don't enjoy eating the same thing everyday. I stumbled upon millet in my cupboard and thought why not use this for breakfast? If you're in need of some change and new recipes, then this recipe is for you!

#### **__Millet Porridge Recipe:__**

- 1/3 cup millet, rinsed 

- 2/3 cup filtered water

- 2 tbsp. chia seeds, soaked in a little water

- 1 apple, diced

- 1/2 cup wild blueberries

- 1 tbsp. coconut oil, organic, virgin, and cold-pressed

- 1-2 tbsp. cinnamon and/or cinnamon stick

- 1/2 banana, sliced

- 3 tbsp. hemp hearts

#### **Instructions:**

  Soak and rinse the millet. In a small pot, combine the rinsed millet with water (and cinnamon stick if using) and bring it to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cover it for 20 minutes.  

  In your serving bowl, soak your chia seeds in a little bit of water.   

  While the millet cooks, chop your apples and blueberries.  

  After 15 minutes of cooking, add in coconut oil, cinnamon powder and stir well. Then add the apples, blueberries, and bananas to slightly warm them.  

  Remove from heat, top with hemp hearts, et viola, you're done!

If you've never used millet before, it also works great instead of rice and other grains in savoury dinner type dishes. I hope you're inspired to incorporate this small but mighty seed into your diet!

Note: As a caution, those with thyroid conditions should not consume millet on a regular basis as it is a goitrogen. Though most of the goitrogen content will be lost to heat in the cooking process.
