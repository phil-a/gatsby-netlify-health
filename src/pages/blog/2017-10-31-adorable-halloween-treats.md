Want to be creative for what to bring to a Hallowe'en party? Try making these adorable spider/Halloween themed chocolate moulds! It's so easy to make chocolate from scratch, trust me. Whip a batch and freeze.

Step 1: Purchase adorable Halloween themed silicone moulds! You can go to a dollar store, craft store, or ![Amazon](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B074P3WCPM/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=desireradiant-20&camp=15121&creative=330641&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B074P3WCPM&linkId=489ac860a1d661320ee417b7cf29d3f0).

Stirring and stirring and stirring the brew, ouuuu!

So cute, festive, and pretty darn healthy!

Seriously the easiest recipe you'll ever make. You'll always wonder why you never made your own chocolate before.

Now if you have leftover chocolate like me, you can easily pour them into Halloween festive cupcake liners, top them with pumpkin seeds and freeze them as well!

Freeze these for 1 - 2 hours and they're ready!

Cute!

These melt pretty easily so keep them in the fridge until they're ready to be served.

Have a fun (and healthy) Halloween! I hope you give this recipe a try!
