It's no secret that I love smoothies. I am a nutritionist after all. They make me look forward to my mornings!

Could you ditch your morning stimulants (i.e. coffee) for something as nutrient-dense and energy packed as this green smoothie? I think so!

Think about all the of the B vitamins you're getting from the avocado and mango; the Vitamin C from the mango, kale, arugula, wild blueberries, and avocado; the healthy fats from the avocado, hemp hearts, chia seeds, and coconut oil; the plant-protein from the hemp hearts, chia seeds, avocado, greens, and mango; and the fibre especially from the chia seeds.

That's what I call nutrient-dense! (& pretty delicious and oh-so creamy)
 

Recipe:

2 - 3 cups of organic arugula and kale

1 mango, ripe

1/2 cup frozen or fresh wild blueberries

1/2 avocado, ripe

3 tbsp. hemp hearts - Manitoba Harvest

2 tbsp. chia gel (2 tbsp. chia seeds soaked in water)

2 tbsp. coconut shreds

1 tbsp. organic, cold-pressed, virgin coconut oil

Dash of maple syrup

1/3 cup water

Blend everything on high, except the chia seed gel, for about 45 seconds. Add the chia gel after this and blend for another 20 - 30 seconds. This smoothie is THICK, thanks to the avocado and chia gel. Look at how jello-like it stacks!

PS. if you're not a fan of stronger tasting greens (like arugula) you could easily swap it for organic baby spinach! Use what you have! The mango and maple syrup really curb the spicy/bitter taste of the arugula.

Enjoy this recipe and let me know if you try it!
