I love to start every New Year with an Oracle reading for the year ahead. This one's for YOU! My social media followers!⁣
You all as a collective received a 4 card spread! I'd think about them in order with the year divided in 4 quarters.⁣
⁣
𝟏. 𝐓𝐢𝐦𝐞 𝐭𝐨 𝐌𝐨𝐯𝐞 𝐎𝐧⁣
Let go of the old so you can start anew. Fitting to be the 1st card of this spread. At this time of year, you're reflecting on the year before. Reflecting on what you accomplished, big and small; reflecting on what you want to release and not bring with you into the new year; reflecting on what you are proud of that you DO in fact want to bring into the new year. We are in this mindset usually for the first quarter of the year. I recommend writing down on paper what you want to release from the previous year and burning it in flames into ashes. Go outside under the moonlight and discard the ashes.⁣
⁣
𝟐. 𝐌𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐜 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐌𝐚𝐧𝐢𝐟𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠⁣
To manifest your desires into reality, music and sound will be helpful to bring ideas to fruition. Sing, hum, chant, and listen to music while thinking about your desires. Maybe you're in need of a sound healing session? I just so happen to be a sound healer ;) The vibrations from crystal singing bowls are enchanting and truly positively affect the energy of our bodies. ⁣
⁣
𝟑. 𝐏𝐨𝐬𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐄𝐧𝐞𝐫𝐠𝐲⁣
Surround yourself with people and things that make you happy. Whether it be dancing? Friends? Loved ones? Nature walks? Animals? Yoga? Art? Whatever it is that makes YOU happy, pencil that in your schedule. The 3rd quarter would be our summertime, which is the easiest season usually to prioritize fun. Make your happiness a priority.⁣
⁣
𝟒. 𝐑𝐞𝐚𝐝𝐲, 𝐒𝐞𝐭, 𝐆𝐨!⁣
The time is now! This is the 4th card, so this is referring to the 4th quarter of the year. Dive into your deepest desires. Take action.⁣

As a bonus, I pulled one Blind Spot Oracle as well, 2nd picture. The Blind Spot is uncovering what you don't know that you don't know. This card came out by itself very quickly for you all collectively. #56 Sigil is staying in your "Comfort Zone". Pay attention to your state of mind and if staying within your comfort zone is holding you back from the life you truly desire. Change is scary only before you make the change. Sometimes when you taste the waters on the other side, it becomes easier and lessens the fear of change. Living a healthier lifestyle seems scary because we may fear judgement from our peers wondering why we are eating new things, drinking new things, taking certain supplements, adjusting our work schedule to add it time for fitness. We fear the judgement and that can inhibit us from making the change. Don't let this hinder your health and well-being.

I hope you have a loving, peaceful, and happy new year! 2020 vision is the theme for this year, meaning clarity. Listen to your intuition, check in with your feelings. It's the time of clear vision.
