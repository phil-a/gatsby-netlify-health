As a holistic nutritionist, I've heard this excuse from many people. Ever hear someone say, "I'm too busy to cook for myself" ... and those are the people regularly going to restaurants, fast food joints, or ordering UberEats or pizza in.  

I'm all about recipes that don't take long. I also try to use as little dishes as possible ;) forward thinking girl here.

So this recipe will give you all the simplicity you've been looking for. It takes roughly 20-25 minutes to cook and the "prep time" is non-existent because you can chop as you go! [Aside from soaking the lentils in advance.] I highly recommend soaking all your beans with bayleaf to make it easier to digest. 

Watch the video to see how it's done!

Recipe Ingredients:

- 1-2 cups Red Lentils (soaked in water with bayleaf for at least 30mins)

- 1/2 Sweet Potato (made this with squash before and it was delicious too)

- 1 Red Onion

- 1 Portabella Mushroom

- 1 Bell Pepper

- 2-3 cups Spinach

- Herbs & Spices: Organic Curry Masala powder, coriander seed, basil. oregano, sage, cayenne, red chilli peppers, and Himalayan salt

- Oil: either avocado oil or extra virgin olive oil now that it's removed from heat

Directions:

Soak the lentils with bayleaf (to reduce phytic acid content) for at least 30min-1hr. Discard soaking water, rinse, and boil with filtered water. Set timer for 25min.

Chop the sweet potato and place in your steamer, first. After 10 min, add the red onion.

Empty the steamed veggies into your serving bowl. Place your raw washed spinach on top.

Now steam the mushrooms and bell pepper last, only for 1-2 minutes. They don't take much time at all. Once steamed, empty on top of the spinach.

Now, coincidentally the lentils are done at the same time as all the veggies have finished steaming! Empty atop all of your steamed vegetables and use your herbs & spices of choice!

I used: organic curry masala, coriander seed, basil. oregano, sage, cayenne, red chilli peppers, and Himalayan salt. Previous times I've added chopped ginger and it was incredible along side the curry masala spices. Though like always, use the spices you love. Drizzle with your choice of oil, I use either avocado or extra virgin olive oil when I make this recipe. 

Stir it all up together, et viola! Dinner is ready! In 20-25minutes!
