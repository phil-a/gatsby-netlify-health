How to make your own natural toothpaste, with only a few key ingredients!  

Sick of the chemicals and heavy metals found in conventional toothpaste, especially fluoride that has been classified as a neurotoxin? You can purchase natural toothpaste from your local health food store, but if you're a DIY kind of person at heart (like I am), here is my first toothpaste recipe, without essential oils!

Recipe: 

-Organic Cold Pressed Virgin Coconut Oil 

-Sodium Bicarbonate 

-Arrowroot Powder

-Xylitol 

-Mint (ground)   

-Cinnamon 

(you may also use essential oils instead of ground herbs, or both)  

Mix all the ingredients together in a small glass jar, et viola! All done!
