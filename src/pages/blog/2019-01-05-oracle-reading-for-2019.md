I intended to only pick 3 cards, but 1 jumped out before I even picked these, and then I was intuitively guided to pick one extra card. So you all ended up getting 5 cards unintentionally!

 

The first card I will discuss jumped out for you all, I did not pick this one. It's titled: "Wait". It says, don't rush into action right now. Bide your time for better results. If you take action now you'll miss a window of opportunity that's coming up for you shortly. You'll know in your heart when that moment arrives. In the meantime, it's important to meditate and breathe deeply. You're on the verge of receiving information that will alter the course of action you plan to take leading in a more positive direction. By waiting, the outcome will be much more enjoyable than if you took action without this information.

Affirm: "I have infinite patience and I am divinely directed to always be in the right place at the right time."

 

Now onto the cards I picked.

 

The first card I picked for you was: "Mother Healing". As your feelings towards your mother heal, your desires manifest more rapidly and accurately. Heaven asks you to release remaining mother issues. Be unconcerned with how it heals, and be vigilant on releasing any lower energies connected to your mother that could interfere with your life's mission. By releasing any mother issues to Heaven, your heart opens further to accepting joy and blessings into your life. Your mother benefits when you're happy, whether or not she's consciously aware of it. Be willing to forgive and release old issues relating to yourself, your mother, mother figures, or anyone connected to your mother. By cleaning your inner house, you inviting you love, opportunities, abundance, and healing energy to enter your life. 

 

The next card I pulled was: "Music for Manifesting", which interestingly I even picked for myself in my personal oracle reading for 2019. To manifest rapidly, think of your desire while you chant, hum, sing, or play music. Music is a powerful ally on your spiritual path, as it serves to boost your manifestation powers. Music is a part of the invisible realm, and is of a higher frequency than that of the physical plane. It robes us in a protective shield to guard us from negative energies. It also lifts our emotions and thoughts to joyful levels. Your urged to play any possible type of music that suits your mood. Move your body to the music, drawing in the energy of each note. Use music as a manifestation tool. First, sit quietly and think of your desire. Imagine that your dream has already come true, and feel that reality in your stomach as warmth, peace, excitement, or security. Feel gratitude in your hearts. As you enjoy these feelings, began to chant, hum, or sing. This self-made music sends your manifestation into the ethers, where it coagulates into tangible reality! 

 

The next card I pulled was: "Set Your Sights Higher". Increase your standards, and expect more for yourself. Don't settle! This card indicates that you've been trying to rationalize that some situation is okay... when it isn't. You settled for less than you desire & for much less than you deserve. You don't need to compromise! Heaven will help you heal, or will replace troubling situations in your life. All you need to do is ask for heaven's help, and then adhere to the guidance that results. Take time today to visualize and dream about your true heart's desires. Don't worry about being disappointed, you deserve a great life, and you have the power and the Heavenly help to accomplish it. Fear and worry slow down your manifestation, so keep releasing all these to heaven. You may feel intimidated by moving up to a higher Plateau on your journey, however, you have happened to your assurance that you're ready. Reach for the Stars, know that you're qualified and deserving of these gifts, and open your arms to receive them! 

 

I only wanted to pick three cards for you guys... But something was telling me to pick one more, and that was this: "Empowerment". You're more powerful than you realize. It's safe for you to be powerful! This card confirms that your inner power wants to surface. You'll use this power appropriately, and you're incapable of abusing it. Your true friends and the people who really love you, will be happy that you've taken your power back. Empowerment means that you're no longer willing to see yourself as a victim in anyway. It means letting go of all blame with respect to other people, past conditions, or present circumstances. Know that you can be powerful and gentle simultaneously, and still be very effective. 

Affirm: "It's safe for me to be powerful! I accept my god-given power to be used in the service of light and love." Then enjoy the shifts you see around you. Instead of worrying what others think about you, use your power to make the world a better place. You may never feel self-conscious again! 

 

 

What a wonderful oracle card reading. It makes a lot of sense that you don't need to rush into things right now. We all feel immense pressure at the start of the New Year to decide our goals for the New Year, cleanse everything at the start of the year, and write things out. Wait a bit before you rush into things, you may get a bit more clarity this way if you do. 

There is some personal healing work to be done that more than likely involves your relationship with your mother. Spend some time to work through any deep hidden ties that may be holding you back in certain aspects of your life. 

You have the tools to manifest all that you desire and it's highly recommended that you use music for manifestation. Quite interesting that I do sound healing and this was pulled for people who follow me specifically. Whether you are tuning in to my crystal singing bowl livestreams, booking a sound healing session with me, or listening to your favourite songs, use sound & music as a tool. 

Don't settle for less than you deserve this year. You know your worth and you need to increase your standards. What ever situation you end up caught in, assess your feelings and if it serves you. If not, use whatever means necessary to change your environment or improve the circumstances. 

And ladies and gentlemen, embrace your inner power, and embrace the divine feminine and divine masculine within all of you. This is a very special year ahead and you'll be divinely guided. Much love to you all. If you'd like more intuitive guidance, I offer energy healing and sound healing, you can book appointments with me on my website. As always, I will be offering nutrition consultations and bundles if you seek to heal naturally with food this year. My specialties are fertility, hormonal health, mental health, and eating disorders.
