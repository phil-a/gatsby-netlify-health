Sound bath on the New Moon in Aquarius, January 2020

This is an intuitive live sound bath with Crystal Singing Bowls, a Tibetan Singing Bowl, rain sticks, and Olivia Pileggi's voice.  The bowls are tuned to 432hz, and since the note of the 3rd Eye Chakra is "A", that bowl is actually exactly the frequency of 432hz!  

This was filmed on the Aquarian New Moon, though this may be enjoyed any time of year. Headphones recommended but not required.  

Interested in a personal sound healing session? You can book a [sound healing session or an energy healing session here](https://squareup.com/appointments/book/8s5bzidy9x96l3/FF347440VY7EP/services) with Olivia.

Love & Radiance,

Desire Radiant Health
