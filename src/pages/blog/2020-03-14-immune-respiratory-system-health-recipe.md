Prevention, Prevention, Prevention. Can I get an amen? ‚Å£ ‚Å£ 

Cold-Pressed Juice is the best thing to consume when you're sick. With many sick people around us, you might as well consume this to boost your immune system's health, giving yourself a kick start! ‚Å£ ‚Å£ 

I share this with you all to empower you with knowledge. Don't let fear-mongering get to you. Being in a state of fear & stress only weakens your immune system. Knowledge is power. ‚Å£ ‚Å£

RECIPE

In a cold pressed juicer, juice:

- 2 carrots

- 2"-3" ginger

- 1 stalk celery

- 1/2 cup spinach

- 1/2 lemon 

If you only have a blender, you can blend these and strain out the pulp. The juicer I'm using is a cold pressed juicer from Hurom, which I love and highly recommend (super easy to clean as well.)

Stay safe, stay healthy, and please share this simple recipe with your loved ones. ‚Å£ ‚Å£
