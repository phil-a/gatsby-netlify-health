I recently received a new low-glycemic sweetener from Vista Magazine (who I'm an ambassador for) and was challenged to invent a recipe with it. I've been juicing carrots a lot lately for beta-carotene and had a fair amount of carrot pulp left over from my juicer and thought, why not make a carrot ginger dessert and sweeten it with date sugar? That's how this recipe came about!

Firm on the outside, gooey on the inside, does that sound like the kind of dessert you're looking for right now? Read on!

RECIPE

Ingredients:

    Carrot pulp (remainder from juicing 2 carrots) + 1 carrot, shredded

             > if you don't have carrot pulp left over, grate 2-3 carrots 

    2 tbsp. fresh grated ginger

    1 banana, mashed with a fork

    1 cup oat flour (grind 1 cup of oats in a blender)

    1/4 cup oats, steel cut or rolled

    1/2 cup walnuts, soaked

    1.5 tbsp. cinnamon powder 

    2 tsp. date sugar - Liva Foods 

    1/4 tsp. Himalayan salt

    1/2 tsp. nutmeg, freshly grated

    1/2 cup coconut milk, full fat


Instructions:

    Soak the walnuts in filtered water overnight. Discard the water after 8hours.

    Grind the oats into a flour in a blender, unless you already have flour.

    In a large bowl, combine the dry ingredients (oat flour, cinnamon, Liva Foods date sugar, nutmeg, Himalayan salt) and whisk them together.

    Mash one banana with a fork.

    Add the carrot pulp and/or shredded carrots, grated ginger, banana mash, and walnuts. Mix well together with the dry ingredients.

    Add the coconut milk last to moisten and completely incorporate the wet with the dry ingredients. Mix until it is able to be kneaded like a dough.

1. Preheat your oven to the lowest setting, 175Â°F, unless if you have a dehydrator. 

2. Take a heaping tablespoon of the batter and form them into balls in your hands and place them on parchment paper. Dehydrate them in the oven for 2-3 hours or dehydrator for 4-5 hours.
