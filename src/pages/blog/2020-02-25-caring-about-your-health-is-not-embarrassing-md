Caring about your health should not be embarrassing, though we're made to feel like it is something to be embarrassed about. When I was a student in nutrition school, my entire class was advised [by two different teachers] to eat junk food at parties to blend in, otherwise, "people will stop inviting you places." I felt a certain way when that advice was given to us as a class learning about health and how to inspire private clients to a healthier way of life.

I'll give you a personal example... I am vegan, gluten-sensitive, alcohol-free, and coffee-free individual. Do you think I have no friends? Do you think I don't get invited places? News flash, I do! Do people often go out of their way for me to be able to eat with them? Yes, and it's something I just learned to live with. I'm also easily satisfied with an abundance of fruits (especially mangoes) so it's not that hard to accommodate me. Though let's be serious, when I stopped drinking alcohol when I was 20 years old, I lost ALL of my "party friends" which I guess weren't really true friends anyways. We were more like clubbing buddies. 

Aside from that, you meet people that share common interests, people that love you and want to share your company will want to accommodate you, your family might be annoyed but learn to look for vegan options at restaurants, and people will always ask you if red wine is okay since you don't drink alcohol... so funny. 

Honestly, if people don't want to be my friend because I don't drink alcohol or don't eat meat, then they're too superficial for me to even want to surround myself with. I know that's scary to think about if you're just starting to take your health seriously, but think about it, if you already know you'll lose certain friends, just accept the level of your friendship as is currently. Human beings are designed to adapt to changes. Remember boundaries are teaching people how to respect you. I believe veganism is a boundary for me. Don't serve me meat, don't hide butter in my food, don't bring regular cake to my birthday... those are boundaries for people to respect around me. 

Remind yourself why you made certain choices and you'll have a much easier time holding your values. I remind myself why I'm vegan often. I regularly remind myself why I don't drink alcohol or do drugs. I connected with the decisions deeply. What is your hard why for making your choices? If you chose to be vegetarian, write down why and recite it to yourself whenever you want to stray. 

In closing, if you choose to make your health your priority, thinking about your friends, coworkers, or family's reaction shouldn't be what hinders you from success. Fitting in shouldn't take precedent over how you feel. And if you want to break your rules in certain situations, don't beat yourself up either. It's near impossible to be perfect. I've broken my personal alcohol rule approximately once a year on special occasions, and I don't dwell on it. Forgive yourself, move on, be the healthiest version of yourself you desire to be.
