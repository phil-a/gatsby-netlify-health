This recipe is to die for! 

So you may have guessed from my Instagram feed that smoothies are my favourite time of day... you're not wrong by making that assumption.

If you're new to smoothies or never felt inclined to make one, hopefully the gorgeous picture of this raspberry smoothie has sparked a flame inside of you to make one yourself!

Matcha is renowned for being filled with antioxidants and a great alternative to coffee to give you energy in the morning. Raspberries and wild blueberries are also extremely rich in antioxidants. 

This smoothie is also packed with fibre, iron, plant-protein, healthy fats, and phytonutrients! So it looks good, tastes good, and is good for you?! I'm guessing you need this recipe right about now. You're welcome!

Recipe

Ingredients:

1/2 cup Cashew Milk (soaked cashews + water in a 3:1 ratio water to cashews)

Juice of 1/2 a Lemon

1.5 cups Organic Spinach

1/2 cup Raspberries 

1/4 cup Wild Blueberries (frozen or fresh)

1 Banana

1 tsp. Organic Japanese Matcha Powder - DoMatcha

2-3 Fresh Dates (if you only have dried dates, soak them in water overnight)

3 tbsp. Hemp Hearts - Manitoba Harvest 

1 tbsp. Cinnamon

2 tbsp. Organic Chia Seeds (mixed with water)

1 tbsp. Coconut Oil (virgin, cold-pressed, organic, and unrefined)

Directions:

1. Start by soaking 1/4 cup of raw cashews overnight [and the dates if using dried dates].

2. Drain the water the next morning and blend cashews with 3 times the amount of water (3/4 cup if you like to measure). Don't worry about straining it... just add the rest of the ingredients on top! Before you do, mix 2 tbsp. of chia seeds with about 4 tbsp. of water. Stir and set aside.

3. Add everything into the blender except the chia seed gel. Blend on high for about 45 second - 1 minute. Then add the chia seed gel and blend for another 20 seconds.

Et viola! Pour into a tall glass and enjoy! Top with extra raspberries for presentation.

Honestly, this smoothie is so good and a nutrient-dense, energy-packed, healthy start to your day. You're getting an abundance of antioxidants; healthy fats from the coconut oil, hemp, and chia; plant-protein from the spinach, hemp, cashews, and chia; blood sugar balancing from the cinnamon; and a healthy dose of greens in the morning!

Now, if you don't have all these ingredients on hand, don't panic! You can improvise. Just make sure you've got a formula:

Desire Radiant Health go to smoothie formula:

- leafy green vegetables (i.e. spinach, arugula, dandelion greens, etc.)

- fruits (i.e. berries)

- protein (i.e. hemp hearts, protein powder, chia seeds, vegetables, etc.),  

- fibre (i.e. vegetables, chia seeds, freshly ground flaxseeds, fruits, etc.)

- healthy fats (i.e. hemp hearts, chia seeds, coconut oil. avocado, freshly ground flaxseeds, flaxseed oil, hemp seed oil, coconut flakes, nut butter, etc.)

- liquid (water, coconut water, lemon juice, nut milk or seed milk that's preferably homemade, etc.)

- cinnamon (to balance blood sugar spikes)

- Optional: if needed, a sweetener (i.e. dates, banana, maple syrup, or coconut nectar) 

Notice how a lot of my examples overlapped in multiple categories? That's the beauty of fresh whole foods! And if you're scared of putting spinach in your blender, you can start with half an avocado instead! Get used to 'out of the ordinary' additions gradually and start with a few leaves in the smoothie. You'll quickly get over your hesitation. When you realize you can't or just barely taste them, you'll get more courageous and start adding a cup (or more) of greens into your blender!

Love, light, radiance, and health,
Olivia
